## Webcam Motion Recognition


</div>

### Description

A motion recognition control that I developed for my final year's project. Sorry that I'm not able to provide a screenshot for this one as you need to try it to believe it! By using a webcam, this component will be able to recognize the direction of the user's motions. The component is flexible and can be implemented in any application that required motion recognition capability. It lets the users feel like they have some kind of force power to control stuff on the screen. Please vote and comment on it. Thanks.
